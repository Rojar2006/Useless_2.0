# InstaAnnoy


## Basic Details
### Team Name: RETRO


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Roshan - Mar Athanasius College of engineering

### Project Description
When you attempt to open instagram on your android phone, this app prevents access unless the phone is in contant motion.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
To prevent the phone being stationery while using Instagram

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We used an app to monitor if the user opens instagram, if he/she does, they won't be able to access Instagram unless the phone is in constant motion.

The first video showcases the basic app interface and initial working, unfortunately it couldn't be finished due to some issues with the code.

The second video shows the current working model of the app, however instead of just Instagram it blocks all apps if movement is not detected.
